# fourier-series
----

A simple MATLAB script that computes the Fourier series for some kinds of signals. Made originally in 2014.

It shows some basic functions of MATLAB, so may be interesting if you are learning how to use it, especially if you are an Electrical Engineering student.

Also a first test with GitHub.

This script calculates the Fourier Series aproximation of a chosen
signal:
- Rectangular pulse, with option to choose the ON/OFF ratio
- Exponetial function, with option to choose the value for the decaying constant
- Sawtooth function
- Triangular function

After choosing the function type, you choose how many repetitions.

Then you choose the form of Fourier Series to be used: 
- Trigonometric form
- Compact Trigonometric form
- Exponential form

Finally, for the reconstruction, you choose how many coefficients to be used.

The script then prints the coefficients and plots the function, spectrum and phase. The final plot is a comparison of the original and the reconstructed
signal.
